Features
--------

- **JWT Auth** The login used here is restfull and uses JWT Signed Token for verification after logging in.
- **JSON and x-www-form-urlencoded multi** The data sent to the API can i
- **On Air Image Resize** Our API doesn't download the Images right away , it renders it on the air with the public link resizes it without downloading.
- **Base64 Image and URL** We upload your thumbnail to a online Image Hosting named Cloudinary and also return its base64. So you can choose what you need.

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sanudatta11/socialcops-int.git

# Change directory
cd socialcops-int

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm start
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use the Cloudinary APIs for uploading the image on cloud, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

**Note** I have included dummy keys and credentials for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with [*your credentials*] when you are ready to deploy an app.

Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatically
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to send proper data in the API for the request to work properly. Incomplete or
corrupt data results in error code **403**

```
Sample of Thumbnail API Data Input
```

**200**

```
{
	"imageUrl" : "https://test.com/google.png"
}
```

**403** *Wrong Data Parameter Key*
```
{
	"ImageUrl" : "https://test.com/google.png"
}
```

### Why Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in route.js?
For the sake of simplicity I define the routes in according to the work needed.
And we are done!
Cheatsheets
-----------

### <img src="https://frontendmasters.com/assets/es6-logo.png" height="34" align="top"> ES6 Cheatsheet

#### Declarations

Declares a read-only named constant.

```js
const name = 'yourName';
```

Declares a block scope local variable.
```js
let index = 0;
```

#### Template Strings

Using the **\`${}\`** syntax, strings can embed expressions.

```js
const name = 'Oggy';
const age = 3;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
```

#### Modules

To import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.

```js
import name from 'module-name';
```
```js
import * as name from 'module-name';
```
```js
import { foo, bar } from 'module-name';
```

To export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.

```js
export { myFunction };
```
```js
export const name = 'yourName';
```
```js
export default myFunctionOrClass
```

#### Spread Operator

The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.

```js
myFunction(...iterableObject);
```
```jsx
<ChildComponent {...this.props} />
```

#### Promises

A Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

```js
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });
```

The `catch()` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.

```js
p.catch(function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `then()` method returns a Promise. It takes 2 arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.

```js
p.then(function(value) { /* handle fulfillment */ }, function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `Promise.all(iterable)` method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.

```js
Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });
```

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the `this` value. Arrow functions are anonymous.

```js
singleParam => { statements }
```
```js
() => { statements }
```
```js
(param1, param2) => expression
```
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
```

#### Classes

The class declaration creates a new class using prototype-based inheritance.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }

  incrementAge() {
    this.age++;
  }
}
```

### <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mmww2.png" height="34" align="top"> JavaScript Date Cheatsheet

#### Unix Timestamp (seconds)

```js
Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
```

#### Add 30 minutes to a Date object

```js
var now = new Date();
now.setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + 30);
```

#### Date Formatting

```js
// DD-MM-YYYY
var now = new Date();

var DD = now.getDate();
var MM = now.getMonth() + 1;
var YYYY = now.getFullYear();

if (DD < 10) {
  DD = '0' + DD;
} 

if (MM < 10) {
  MM = '0' + MM;
}

console.log(MM + '-' + DD + '-' + YYYY); // 03-30-2016
```
```js
// hh:mm (12 hour time with am/pm)
var now = new Date();
var hours = now.getHours();
var minutes = now.getMinutes();
var amPm = hours >= 12 ? 'pm' : 'am';

hours = hours % 12;
hours = hours ? hours : 12;
minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : minutes;

console.log(hours + ':' + minutes + ' ' + amPm); // 1:43 am
```

#### Next week Date object

```js
var today = new Date();
var nextWeek = new Date(today.getTime() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### Yesterday Date object

```js
var today = new Date();
var yesterday = date.setDate(date.getDate() - 1);
```

----------

You will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application. 

- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [Common problems setting up docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/)

After installing docker, start the application with the following commands : 

```
# Make sure you have sudo Privileges in Linux

# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker build .  

# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker run <image_name>

# Find the image at or pull from Docker Hub
docker pull sanurocks5/socialcops

```

To view the app, find your docker ip address + port 3000 ( this will typically be http://192.168.99.100:3000/ ).


Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **AWS** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support and free tier support a lot.
